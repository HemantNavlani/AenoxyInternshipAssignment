# Description 

We have set up the pages and starting the project from home page and set up routes to go to various other pages, after home page we go signup page and we have used react redux for managing the states, we have not used backend services so we are keeping data in states so that we can access it later but the data goes away on reload as it is present in state without using any storage services, after this we go to the profile page where we select the image and the location, then after clicking on next we go to the role selection page, after that we go to email verification page, where we have not implemented actual verification facility, just we have implemented a timeout function, and then we again go to the home page, and it shows Get Started button since the state has the data of the user.
